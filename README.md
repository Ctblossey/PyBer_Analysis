# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of [this project](https://github.com/Ctblossey/PyBer_Analysis) is to take a deeper look at ride-sharing data and analyze fare trends for different city types. By looking at the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources), you can see that there is really good information, but it needs to be analyzed. Key takeaways to look for with data like this are ride distribution, driver distribution, and fare distribution. 


## Results

* ### Within the data, we saw an inverse relationship between volume and cost. The rankings of rides and drivers based on volume were Rural, Suburban, and then Urban with the most. As for average fares, the rankings were Urban, Suburban, and then Rural with the most.

* ### Breakdown of rides/drivers:
    - ### Rural: 125/78
    - ### Suburban: 625/490
    - ### Urban: 1625/2405

* ### Breakdown of average fare per ride/driver:
    - ### Rural: $34.62/$55.49
    - ### Suburban: $30.97/$39.50
    - ### Urban: $24.53/$16.57

## Summary

### There are three main suggestions that I would make based on the data collected. First, I would recommend collecting distance and time for each ride. Although not likely, it is possible that the average fare per mile is the same for all three areas. Getting the distance for each ride will solidify the differences between areas. Second, I would increase the amount of drivers in rural and suburban areas. Based on the data, there is a correlation between higher prices and less drivers. Hopefully this change would bring the averages closer. Finally, I would push for more drivers in late February. As shown in the graph, there is a spike in fares, most likely from the weather beginning to be nicer. One way to help increase the number of drivers is to create incentives for all the drivers that work during this time.
