# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of [this project](https://github.com/Ctblossey/PyBer_Analysis) is to take a deeper look at ride-sharing data and analyze fare trends for different city types. By looking at the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources), you can see that there is really good information, but it needs to be analyzed. Key takeaways to look for with data like this are ride distribution, driver distribution, and fare distribution.
